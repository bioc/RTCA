Version 1.6-1
+ To avoid confusion, "by Roche" has been removed from the title, and the contact email has been changed.

Version 1.5.2
+ plateView function had a typo which is now fixed

Version 1.5.1
+ Option "skipWells" of function "parseRTCA" is renamed as "maskWells". It now accepts either well name(s) or a regular expression pattern as character string.
+ Internally the parseRTCA will not skip the first line automatically as it did before. Instead it first detects whether there are lines with duplicated time points; if so, it keeps the first appearance and removes the rest items. 

Version 1.1.1
New Features:
+ Add 'spectramaxImport' function (moved from internal caUtils package) for WST validation assays, which can also be applied elsewhere in combination with 'cellHTS2' package
Bug Fix:
+ The parseRTCA function removes 'extended=TRUE' option in calling grep, since this option is obsolete (thanks Nishant)
+ Modify the Makefile since the public name of the package is 'RTCA'
